# Comparing Noise Simulation Models for Evaluating Stability of Modeling in Neuroimaging

The processed subset of the NKI-RS dataset for evaluation of various perturbation modes when studying instabilities. This repository contains material used to create the [paper found here](https://doi.org/10.1177%2F1094342020926237), for which the [data lives here](https://zenodo.org/record/3755200), can be visualized using the [plotting code here](https://github.com/gkpapers/2020ComparingNoiseModels/blob/master/code/dipy_exploratory/mca_dipy_exploratory_analysis.ipynb), and generated with various [scripts and launch configurations found here](https://github.com/gkpapers/2020ComparingNoiseModels/tree/master/code/experiments/).

The "raw" dataset must be obtained directly from the [NKI-Rockland Sample webpage](http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/enhanced/data.html).
